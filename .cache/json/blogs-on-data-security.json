But nowadays many app or web services are seemingly for free. But they are not really free. No, such services customers are not paying with money they pay with data. </p>\n<p>Data has become a currency. Thus the big question remains: who owns the data. Is it the customerâ€™s data or is it the companies data, since customers paid with their data? </p>\n<p>Independent of an answer to this very question, one thing is for sure: data and especially personal data need to be protected.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure this, the issue of data security becomes a central topic. Data security needs to be an inbuilt feature into any digital offer or service.</p>\n<p>Here are the areas which data security needs to deal with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Security of transfer: PGP, HTTPS, TSL / SSL, etc.</li>\n<li>Security of access: Authentification.</li>\n<li>Security of databases: Encryption, division of concerns.</li>\n<li>Security of transactions: PIN / TAN etc.</li>\n<li>Security of passwords: Finger prints, face recognition.</li>\n<li>Security of systems: Protection from viruses, ransomware, espionage.</li>\n<li>Security for company clouds: Data may be accessible by cloud provider.</li>\n<li>Security of encryption: Choose the right procedure. Not all encryptions are safe.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"On Data Security","author":"Dr. Ulrich Anders","date":"April 14, 2018"}}},"pathContext":{"slug":"/blogs/on-data-security/"}}
